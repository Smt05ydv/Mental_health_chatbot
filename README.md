🌿 CalmMind – Mental Health Chatbot (Frontend UI)

A modern, interactive mental-health companion UI built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring a chatbot interface, mood selector, self-assessment tools, breathing animations, chat history, profile page, and personal notes.

This UI is designed to later connect with a real backend (Node.js/Express) or AI/NLP model to provide emotional support and mental-wellness guidance.
